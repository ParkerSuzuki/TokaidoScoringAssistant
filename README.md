# Tokaido Scoring Assistant
## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a responsive and intuitive web application to streamline scoring for the board game Tokaido. The application will provide users with an interactive and visually engaging interface that simplifies the process of calculating final point totals. By leveraging images and a user-friendly design, the app ensures that scoring is both quick and accurate, reducing manual effort and errors during gameplay.
## Key Features:
- Interactive User Interface (UI): A dynamic and visually appealing design featuring clickable components for seamless score entry.
- Real-time Calculations: Automatic point tallying as users input scores, reducing the need for manual computation.
## Technical Approach:	
- Architecture: The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to ensure clean code organization, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
- Technology Stack:
- Frontend and Backend Development: Implemented using Blazor, a modern framework that supports C# for both client-side and server-side logic.
- Framework Selection: Blazor is chosen for its seamless C# integration, enabling me to leverage existing expertise rather than relying on JavaScript frameworks.
Why Blazor?
Blazorâ€™s ability to use C# across the full stack aligns with my skillset, allowing faster development without sacrificing functionality. Its component-based structure also supports modular design, ensuring future scalability and feature enhancements.
